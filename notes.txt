Check Images(container-overview, container-view, namespaces-*)

Namespacing: isolating resources per process.(or groups of processes)
Control groups (CGroups): limit amount of resources used per process.
So Namespacing says hey this area of hard drive is for this process and
control groups can be used to limit the amount of memory, cpu i/o, network bandwidth.
These two feature put together can ISOLATE a single process. It can limit the
amount of resources a process can talk to and limit the amount of bandwidth it can make use of.
This Namespacing and Control Groups conepts is only in LINUX.
Image(docker-linux-vm). So we actually downloaded a LINUX Virtual Machine
with docker. This linux machine has kernel which is responsible for running
containers and limiting resources for containers from our computer.
Run: docker version -- (Output has)
OS/Arch:          linux/amd64


Container is an instance of an image. It is a program that has its own set of hardware resources.
So a running process with the resources it can talk to can be called a container.

Image: is like a file system snapshot, with a specific set of directories/folder
and a startup command.

Image: image-container-relationship.png

So we load those image directories on to a process (that is isolated
from rest of the system and has access to a portion of the specified resoucres only)
and run the image start up command in that process.
We are running a CONTAINER.




Image(elasticbeanstalk-scale-strategy)
So elasticbeanstalk scale strategy might run more copies of our complete containers
based on info in Dockerrun.aws.json. So more machines, less control.
Hence Kubernetes. So in Image kubernetes-strategy.png, we see we can control what is running in which
node and how many containers we want to run. So more control.
